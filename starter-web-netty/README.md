## Google Cloud Run Deployment

From the project root build the docker image and push it to Google Container Registry:

```
$ docker build . -t micronaut-starter -f DockerfileCloudRun
$ docker tag micronaut-starter gcr.io/[PROJECT ID]/micronaut-starter
$ docker push gcr.io/[PROJECT ID]/micronaut-starter
```

You are now ready to deploy your application:

```
$ gcloud beta run deploy --image gcr.io/[PROJECT ID]/micronaut-starter 
```

Where `[PROJECT ID]` is replaced for your project ID. You should see output like the following:

```
Service name: (micronaut-starter):
Deploying container to Cloud Run service [micronaut-starter] in project [PROJECT_ID] region [us-central1]
